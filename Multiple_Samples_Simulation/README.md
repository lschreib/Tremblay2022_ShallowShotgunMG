The provided R script was used to simulate the effects of adding addtional metagenome samples for a constant sequencing depth as carried out in: Tremblay,J., Schreiber,L., Greer, C.W. 2022. "High resolution shotgun metagenonimcs: the more data the better?"

The analyses were carried out using the attached R packages:

* ggplot2 3.3.5
* vegan 2.5-7
* lattice 0.20-44
* permute 0.9-5
* readr 1.4.0

Instructions on how to carry out the analysis are provided within the R script and it is strongly recommended to run the script interactively in R Studio.

The rpoB count table ("Agricultural_Soil_rpoB_ct_20220831.RData") of the agricultural soil dataset of Tremblay et al. (2022) is provided as an example dataset.
